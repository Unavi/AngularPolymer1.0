# AngularPolymer1.0

Just got started with this so any help is appreciated.

Package includes:

Meteor
* Iron-Router
* netanelgilad:angular2-typescript

Bower
* Polymer
* Polymer - Iron Elements
* Polymer - Paper Elements

Under `public/polymer/lib/` you can find the file `imports.html` [[1]](https://github.com/Unavi/AngularPolymer1.0/blob/master/public/polymer/lib/imports.html) used for the polymer imports.

To recompile go to this location und run `vulcanize imports.html > polymerVulcanized.html`

Here you can find [vulcanize](https://github.com/polymer/vulcanize).

Porblems:
Right now the html templates aren't loaded. It worked at some point so if you have any idea every help is more than welcome :smile:
