# AngularPolymer1.0

Just got started with this so any help is appreciated.

Package includes:

Meteor
* Iron-Router
* netanelgilad:angular2-typescript

Bower
* Polymer
* Polymer - Iron Elements
* Polymer - Paper Elements

Under `public/polymer/components/` you can add your custom templates.

Then add them to the `custom-components.html`.
